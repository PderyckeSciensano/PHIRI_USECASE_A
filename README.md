PHIRI is the roll-out of the research infrastructure on population health information that aims to facilitate and generate the best available evidence for research on health and well-being of populations as impacted by COVID-19. PHIRI allows for better coordinated European efforts across national and European stakeholders to generate the best COVID-19 population health knowledge. In doing so, PHIRI is laying the foundation to build a Distributed Infrastructure on Population Health (DIPoH) to be used to overcome future crisis and ensure the sustainability of the project. The intent is to support research across Europe through the identification, access, assessment and reuse of population health and non-health data to underpin public health policy decisions. This is achieved through a close collaboration with 41 partners across 30 countries over a period of 36 months (November 2020 - November 2023). The project is divided in 9 ambitious work packages with three transversal topics. PHIRI builds on the achievements of the BRIDGE Health and the Joint Action on Health Information (InfAct) projects.

# Use Case A - Vulnerable population groups
*Research question:*
Has the COVID19 pandemic changed existing patterns of non-COVID-19 health care utilisation and mortality for vulnerable populations within and between countries? This is based around answering the indirect effects of the pandemic on population health.

*Cohort description:*
Any patients 18 years old or older, with a hospital episode with a main diagnosis of any of the conditions included in the cohort definition (i.e. heart attack, stroke, hip or knee replacements, or severe trauma) from 2019-01-01 until today.
